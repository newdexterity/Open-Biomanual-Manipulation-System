The torso clavicle unit houses two motors responsible for shoulder bending and shoulder flexion. The clavicle arms can be reinforced with carbon fiber plates to prevent plastic buckling.
The unit also comes with a detachable shoulder flexion mounting unit. The flexion mounting also has tendon-driven locking ratchet mechanism which can be made from sandwhiched parts.

# Parts Needed
## 3D Printed


## Carbon Fiber Sheets


## Mechanical parts

* 8 X OBMP-TB-1011 (M8 threaded rod, 200 mm lengths)
* 16 X M8 Nuts
* 16 X M8 Washers
* 20 X M6 Nuts (go on the inside of the plates)
* 10 X M4 Bolts (support alignment bolts for holding the plates in place)
* 10 X M4 Nuts

# Notes
## Ratchets (obmp-tcu-1181 & obmp-tcu-1182)

obmp-tcu-1182 is the mirrored version of obmp-tcu-1181, when building, the mirrored parts can be made by changing the install orientation of the M2 screw.
The ratchets can be assembled using obmp-tcu-1189 and two pieces of obmp-tcu-p3-1188. The lever arm is made of a M2x40 mm screw.

## Absolute output sensing (obmp-tcu-1149)

The part obmp-tcu-1149 is designed for direct joint angle sensing for the shoulder rotation axis. This is an optional part as the current system relies on the low backlash harmonic drives to perform correctly.
