The torso base is a simple box designed to enclose around a pair of linear rails. The sandwhiched plates allows an assortment of attachement points for different systems.
Using two layers of 5 mm thich carbon fiber boards, the box structure is connected by M8 threaded rods to provide the mounting point for the robot arms and transmission mechanisms

# Parts Needed

* 10 X M4 Nuts

# Notes
## M8 Threaded Rod

The threaded rods in the CAD is 200 mm long. This can be shortened to 170 mm or 180 mm, just save enough space for the washer and nut to go on.
The threaded rods runs the length of the 3d printed obmp-tb-1010 part, this can be easily assembled by taking the threaded rod held in a cordless drill and drill the rods into the plastic part like a threading tap.

## M6 Connectors

The front plate, obmp-tb-1010 and the associated carbon fiber plates are connected to the base frame via 6xM6 mounting point on each side. 
For mounting on the simple base stand, use a 20x20 mm aluminium extrusion to create an intersecting structure to attach to the verticle structure of the base stand.

## Carbon Fiber

The parts with P-xxxx means plates for carbon fiber parts, the thickness used for the torso base are 5 mm and 2 mm sheets.
