## 0.8.1 2019-09-25

Add i2t calculation to diagnostics.

## 0.8.0 2019-09-24

Publish diagnostics, including status from 0.7.0 and motor state.

## 0.7.0 2019-09-06

Backed out automatic preroll, it's now done manually under user control.
Status publishing on /odrive/status topic, so you can check connection/preroll/ready state externally.
Temperature reading.

## 0.6.0 2019-07-24

Added more careful error checking, in particular looking for USB comms loss vs other errors
Watchdog timer now used.

## 0.5.0 2019-07-15

Added facility to import odrive_interface into an odrivetool shell for testing.
More error checking and recovery.
Initial work towards providing a simulation mode for use in gazebo.

## 0.4.0 2019-03-19

Reworked all ODrive comms into a fast+slow thread. 
Added error recovery on comms failure.
Added auto preroll on first drive.

## 0.3.1 2018-11-01

Max speed and angular velocity parameter.

## 0.3.0 2018-10-15

Now uses the ODrive `preroll` branch to allow use of encoders with no index. 
Set ROS param `use_preroll` to False for old behaviour.

Added diff-drive odometry calculation and publishing to both ROS topic and tf
Added current calculation

Pulls encoder counts from driver

## 0.2.1 2018-10-03

Bug in startup sequence (calibrated twice)

## 0.2.0 2018-09-25

Various services for connecting, calibrating, engage/release, etc.
Parameters to set whether connection and calibration happens on startup.

## 0.1.2 2018-09-12

Abstracted left/right motors up into the node, so axis0 and axis1 can be assigned to either.
Fixed dumb bug in cleaning up node class.

## 0.1.1 2018-09-10

- Switched to modified BSD license from MIT, same as ROS proper.

## 0.1.0 2018-09-07

- Turned into a proper ROS package: just need to checkout repository into your workspace's src/ dir.

## 2018-07-31

- Initial commit
